          <h2><strong>What does a user experience UX designer do?</strong></h2>

   <mark>A UX designer</mark> is concerned with the entire process of acquiring and integrating a product,
   including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.
    <strong>The story begins before the device is even in the user's hands.</strong>
     â€œNo product is an island. A product is more than the product

<h3>What is an example of user experience in UX?
    The definition of user experience (UX)</h3>

<strong>Let's take as an example an e-commerce website.</strong>
If a customer finds the buying experience to be long, 
complex and complicated,
then her UX will be a bad one.
Say instead her purchasing experience is
easy and hustle free, 
then the UX will be considered a good one
